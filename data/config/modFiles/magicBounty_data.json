As the leader of the expedition, he refurbished the specimen at the newely found colony within the system but greed got the better of him and immediately decided to wipe and falsify all the records relative to the ship and expedition. Then ordered a saturated bombardment of the colony.\nThe truth eventually reached the High Hegemon Baikal Daud which then ordered a hefty bounty on this greedy warcriminal. But the Hegemony's attempts at bringing justice to this man have been futile, not to mention he is very thorough in striking terror in the bounty hunters that come after him.\nHe usually lays low around the fringes of the sector and is hard to track, yet there was a report from a scavenger who managed to escape him. His goal is currently unknown.\n\nThis man is a hegemony warcriminal of the highest order and is to be eliminated on sight.",
