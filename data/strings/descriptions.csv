Beheslaught_XIV,SHIP,"An insane ship that could have only come from someone who was using substances, or a crazy AI, this ship was created by DN3's gamma AI after it had began malfunctioning. When the AI had been confiscated and questioned by AI experts it claimed that it was also DN3, upon being asked why it had made such a ship, it gave a rather confusing answer, apparantly quoting something the original engineer had said somewhere: ""This is what happens when you are bored and decide to shitbash"".",,,,
Tanngrisni_XIV,SHIP,An experimental XIV ship that was made for testing out how in theory a ship that orginally seemed like it was intended to be outfitted with energy weapons will handle a ballistic loadout. ,,,,
Trajan_XIV,SHIP,"A large support carrier, it saw several modifications from it's original design in terms of inner circuitry and components, the performance interested the XIV Battlegroup into making it available for their own officers. ",,,,
Knobkerrie_XIV,SHIP,"A massive experimental ship that was funded by high ranking XIV officers, at the cost of many smaller turrets and point defence capabilities, attempts to focus the majority of available weapon space on three aggressive large missile hardpoints.",,,,
Kana_XIV,SHIP,"The original design was seen in action by travelling XIV officers who were visiting the Legionary republic undercover, their excited reports entailed more work for XIV engineers in order to reverse engineer, and then create a copy of that ship for the XIV Battlegroups fleet.",,,,
Crossbow_XIV,SHIP,"A very unordinary looking ship, was taken up as a sort of hobby project by an engineer who thought that such a ship could be of use to the XIV Battlegroup, further contact with that engineer seemed to have been lost after the ships original creators found out about the project. ",,,,
Cassowary_XIV,SHIP,"After the previous defeat of one of the rarest ships in the sector at the hands of the Hegemony, the XIV Battlegroup took interest in such a unique ship and managed to reverse engineer that ship from the salvaged remains and with some genuis ship engineers working on the project, managed to make such a ship available for construction for the XIV Battlegroup.",,,,
Haast_XIV,SHIP,"Originally a massive midline design, the XIV Battlegroup had come to the decision that it had insufficient ships of the line for all possible situations, and so an order was placed for the creation of what is now know as the XIV Haast. ",,,,
Executor_XIV,SHIP,"No one knows exactly where the original design had appeared from, although local rumours say that its origins have something to do with the words of ""Archeon Order"", however what that is, no one has found out yet... And the XIV Battlegroup isn't telling.",,,,
Ingria_XIV,SHIP,"A lowtech design that was found in the folder of some low class XIV officer, it seems pretty outdated but in the present day sector everything can be put to good use.",,,,
Sevastoron_XIV,SHIP,"An odd looking design that was mothballed and burying under tons of paperwork and unfiled tax reports. The Sevatoron Sports a surprisingly strong armament but as a result suffers from a battlecruisers armour and hull hitpoints, in effect, the Sevastoron is classified in the Hegemony database as a ""fast battleship"".",,,,
Pegasus_XIV,SHIP,"The Pegasus was an aspirational design initiative by Altair Exotech building off the immense profit and prestige generated by the ""Cruiser School"" turn of the Domain Armada procurement arm. Orion Shipyards, the primary supplier of capital craft to the Armada, naturally considered this an imposition on a field it had dominated up to that point. Many of the old admirals agreed and uptake was slow; nevertheless, the Pegasus anchored several of the newer battlegroups and found favor among a generation of young officers.

The unparalleled heavy missile-focused loadout is a striking distinction from more traditional designs, allowing the Pegasus to compromise on scale of power systems and flux-handling while maintaining respectable armor, top speed, and maneuverability. Traditionalists criticize the Pegasus' ""staying power"" under fire while counter-critics respond that if a fleet finds itself under sustained heavy fire, it has already made a serious tactical error. Despite the debates (which continue to this day) the combat performance of the Pegasus-class has earned it begrudging respect even from detractors. This is a 14th battlegroup variant with slightly better specs and repurposed mounts.",,,,

Harrier_XIV,SHIP,"A post-collapse design created as part of a midline package by a freelance engineer in the sector, the XIV Battlegroup requested for that engineer to make another package of the ships he had made to be built to their specifications. ",,,,
Stormhawk_XIV,SHIP,"Made by a non-disclosed source whos codename was Î£nzoci, this ship was created within the ranks of the XIV Battlegroup in order to compensate the Battlegroups lack of LPC support, intended as an aggresive assault carrier that will work together with several cruisers, or en mass during battles of the line.",,,,
Tremor_XIV,SHIP,"A cruiser that looks rather... Underwhelming, it nontheless is still deadly, with it sporting a large missile and two supporting medium turrets, it was deadly enough to catch the eye of the XIV Battlegroup.",,,,
Division_XIV,SHIP,"An seemingly exotic and unordinary cruiser, it had only been recently created by a duo of brilliant engineers working within the sector, such a work could of course not pass by an elite battlegroup of the hegemony.",,,,
Vulture_XIV,SHIP,"True to its name, the vulture cruiser appears to have been initially specialized in preying on nearly dead ships, upon inaugeration into the XIV Battlegroups lineup it is expected to continue fullfilling its original roll, yet more effectively. ",,,,
Owl_XIV,SHIP,"Created by an AI mixing a hammerhead and an eagle, the result became the owl, naturally due to the hegemonies distrust with AI related issues, an XIV officer was dispatched to investigate, the AI core they had found was burnt to a crisp, yet there was still data that could be recovered. Due to high level XIV officers having a pragmatic mindset, they decided that they won't froth at the mouth like the Luddic parth regarding anything to do with AI, and put the original Owl blueprint into use. ",,,,
Owl_spec_ops_XIV,SHIP,"A top secret and ambitious XIV project, using an AI perfected ship they decided that this design was suitable for a top notch, stealth cruiser. Sacrificing many things like storage, fuel storage, and flight decks. They created a ship whose specs had increased by roughly 20% compared to its baseline alongside a significantly reduced sensor profile. ",,,,
Phoca_XIV,SHIP,"Taking the concept of a broadside battleship and applying it to a cruiser sized hull resulted in the Phoca, as one XIV Battlegroup officer jokingly dubbed the cruiser, ""it is a cruiser of the line"". ",,,,
Charon_XIV,SHIP,"A ship that looks surprisingly similiar to a colony ship from the game of ""Galactic Civilizations 3"", it nevertheless is not as defenceless. An XIV engineer that was a fan of that game decided that instead of settling planets it would do good by burning them down to the stone age.",,,,

Potterycup_XIV,SHIP,"A rather fragile name for a not so fragile ship, potterycup had caught the eye due to its design which originated from a rather odd sounding place, seafood industries. The potterycup XIV variant was created when the Battlegroup decided that it wanted to expand upon the ships it had available for deployment.",,,,
Aghast_XIV,SHIP,"A curious ship design, its primary roll appears to be missile support alongside a very concentrated yet limited point defence coverage, a niche ship that the XIV Battlegroup adopted to escort or support heavy cruiser and larger ship classes. ",,,,
Armadillo_XIV,SHIP,"A defense focused destroyer, a ship desgined to weather the brunt of ships a class above its own and distract them in order to give other fellow captains the chance to land a decisive blow on the opponents ship.",,,,
Gorget_XIV,SHIP,"A standard destroyer design, was adopted by the XIV Battlegroup when the decision was made to expand the hulls available to the battlegroup to give it more flexibility.",,,,
Scalpel_XIV,SHIP,"A seemingly unergunned destroyer design, its primary function is to be an escort, it sports a higher than normal flux capacity for a destroyer, a LPC hangar, and 4 small missile slots. ",,,,
Cassina_XIV,SHIP,"This ship appears to be the combination of the gunship approach with the base hull of a destroyer, sporting very forward located armament and 4 small missile slots, it could have been made for one purpose and one purpose only... For the XIV officer to launch 4 Reapers down the throat of whatever Luddite ship, or enemy ship, appears in front of him. ",,,,
Dart_XIV,SHIP,"A small and light destroyer hull, it can't really do anything much aside from harassing the living hell out of the opponents and running away, an XIV officer thought argued that mad enemies are incompetent enemies, and proved so in a mock battle with another officer which resulted in the smashed screen of the officer on the receiving end of these ships. And that's how it got introduced into the XIV database. ",,,,
,,,,,,

,,,,,,
Velite_XIV,SHIP,"A quick ship, the velite was made to harass enemy destroyers and distract as many missiles with its active flare launcher as it possibly can before it perishes in a ball of flame along with the crew.",,,,
Hartfell_XIV,SHIP,"It is a small ship, it sports a lot of firepower, and although it is classified as a frigate a more correct term for this kind of ship would be a gunship. Due to its firepower to size ratio it very quickly came to attention of an XIV officer, and shortly found its way into the XIV Battlegroup lineup.",,,,
Sawtooth_XIV,SHIP,"Another example of an idea that theoretically should work well on paper, an XIV officer seems to have also read that paper and agree with that conclusion. Hence the sawtooth was intorduced and accepted into the XIV lineup, earning the coined term of ""missile death box"" by the unlucky crew members of these ships. ",,,,
Baronin_XIV,SHIP,"A small yet surprisingly strongly equipped frigate, the Baronin comes equipped with a weapon that is normally only carried by the mighty onslaught itself.",,,,

storm_harpoon,WEAPON,"The Stormhawk's built_in weapon, the Storm Harpoons are slightly modified Harpoon MRMs produced by nanoforges in various points of the ship.",,,,
