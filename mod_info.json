Big thanks to all the authors of these ships and for their help with understanding the relevant art and code stuff! May periodicially add a couple ships once i learn to shitbash or ships other people have found that are ownerless or made themselves that they wish to send me. In the last two cases dm me on the starsector server. Have fun!",
